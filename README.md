This was from assignment 1 of UWO CS4483. We were given a list of words and told to choose two and then make a vertical or horizontal slice of a game based on them. The two words I chose were "coffee" and "monsters".

# Morning Routine
## Matthew Borinsky
This was a lot of fun to make but very challenging. 
I knew nothing about 2D unity and I definitely learned a lot. I got the jumping and all related animations working and designed the scene myself.
I really like the concept that the rooms do not take up the whole screen. I think it makes the gameplay more dynamic and the scenes more interesting. 
The player does not get stuck on walls or ceilings either and all levels can now be easily built as the basis behind them such as tiles have all be set up.
You can press shift to run and if you jump while running you will fly further than if you jump while walking. 
I cannot find a shadow monster to use so I will have to figure that out for the next assignment. 
In the meantime, I added a water tornado as a representation. 
Fighting animations are ready and all set up but have been removed from the game as they were breaking the flow of the other animations. 
They were not my goal for this assignment though so I do not mind. The health/timer and combat with monsters will be the next goal as well.
The platformer aspect was my main concern with this since those extra parts were additions to make the final product more interesting.
For this part, I was most concerned with creating the general idea of the game which I think I have done very well. 

### This is a vertical slice
I have designed all of the platformer mechanics and main components of the game.
This will be the first learning level of the game where the future ones become progressively harder and the surrounding world becomes more surreal and weird. 
i.e. a platformer area of fridges and endless bathtubs.
I have also made level creation very simple in the future by spending a lot of time setting up tiles.
The levels can now be built like in super mario maker 2. 
This cannot be seen as easily from the gameplay but it will help me a lot on the back end in the future.

### To win
There is a floating coffee you find which you then have to bring back to the bed in order to win.
